# Minecraft In Python (Made With Ursina Engine)

I Made Minecraft In Python Using [Ursina Engine](https://www.ursinaengine.org/) By Following Some [Tutorial](https://youtu.be/DHSRaVeQxIk).

You Can Run The Code By Installing Ursina Engine By Following [This](https://www.ursinaengine.org/#Getting%20Started) Then ```python main.py```
Use The Code And Change It Like You Want. I Don't Want Any Crediting Or Anything Like That Since It's Not My Code Or Assets...

Right Click To Break Block, Left Click To Place Blocks.
To Change Between Blocks Like 1, 2, 3 Or 4

1 = Grass Block
2 = Stone Block
3 = Brick Block
4 = Dirt Block
